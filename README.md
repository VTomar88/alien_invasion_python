# alien_invasion_python
_"**Let's build a game!**"_ We build this project to learn nuances of big project like backhand thinking process and algorithms needed to prepare a game. This game involves every ingredient of programming esp., Python. 
## Motivation
Using pygame, we created a ship that moves left and right, and fire bullets to destroy fleet of aliens. You earn the points on hitting an alien ship. Level up when the fleet is destroyed.
